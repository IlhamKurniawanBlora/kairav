## Project Overview

Jurutani is a comprehensive digital agriculture platform designed to revolutionize traditional farming practices through the power of IoT technology and data analytics. The platform bridges the gap between modern technology and agriculture, providing farmers with real-time insights and automated solutions to optimize their crop production.

## The Challenge

Traditional farming methods often rely on intuition and experience, which can lead to:
- Inefficient water usage and resource management
- Delayed response to critical crop conditions
- Limited visibility into soil and environmental factors
- Difficulty in tracking crop performance over time
- Manual monitoring processes that are time-consuming and prone to errors

## Our Solution

Jurutani addresses these challenges by providing:

### Smart Monitoring System
The platform integrates multiple IoT sensors deployed across farm fields to continuously monitor:
- Soil moisture levels
- Temperature and humidity
- Light intensity
- pH levels
- Nutrient content

### Real-Time Dashboard
A comprehensive web-based dashboard that displays:
- Live sensor data with interactive charts
- Historical trends and patterns
- Weather forecasts integration
- Crop health indicators
- Resource usage analytics

### Automated Control Systems
Intelligent automation features including:
- Automatic irrigation based on soil moisture thresholds
- Climate control for greenhouse environments
- Nutrient dosing systems
- Pest detection alerts

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture
Built with Vue.js 3 and the Composition API, the frontend provides:
- Responsive design optimized for desktop and mobile devices
- Real-time data visualization using Chart.js
- Interactive maps showing sensor locations
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for offline access

### Backend Infrastructure
The Node.js backend handles:
- RESTful API endpoints for data management
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- MQTT broker integration for IoT device communication
- Data processing and analytics algorithms
- User authentication and authorization

### Database Design
MongoDB stores:
- Time-series sensor data with efficient indexing
- User profiles and farm configurations
- Historical analytics and reports
- System logs and maintenance records

### IoT Integration
Hardware components include:
- ESP32 microcontrollers for wireless connectivity
- Various sensors (soil moisture, temperature, pH)
- Relay modules for irrigation control
- Solar panels for sustainable power supply

## Key Features Breakdown

### 1. Multi-Sensor Integration
The platform supports various sensor types and can easily accommodate new sensor technologies as they become available. Each sensor is calibrated and validated to ensure accurate readings.

### 2. Intelligent Alerts
Advanced alerting system that notifies farmers via:
- Email notifications
- SMS alerts for critical situations
- Push notifications through the mobile app
- Dashboard notifications with severity levels

### 3. Data Analytics
Comprehensive analytics engine that provides:
- Predictive modeling for crop yield
- Resource optimization recommendations
- Seasonal trend analysis
- Comparative performance metrics

### 4. Mobile Application
Companion mobile app features:
- Real-time monitoring on-the-go
- Remote control of irrigation systems
- Photo-based crop health assessment
- Offline data synchronization

## Impact and Results
